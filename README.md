# login-php-template
it's a template for functioning login page

the goal of this project was firstly to learn php and to get use to the dev environement. I use MAMP to run the project

to run the web server in the htdocs folder of the MAMP folder put all the files you download,
run the web server and go to #localhost/phpmyadmin then with the file 'db.sql' recreate the mysql database.
